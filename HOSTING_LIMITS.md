# Netlify Hosting Limits & Costs

Great news: **You likely do not need to pay anything.**
Your website is optimized to run almost entirely on the "Client-Side" (user's device), which saves you huge amounts of server costs.

### 1. Free Tier Limits (Starter Plan)
| Resource | Limit | Your Usage Estimate | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Bandwidth** | 100 GB / month | ~2MB per visit × 50,000 visits | **Safe** ✅ |
| **Build Minutes** | 300 mins / month | ~1 min per deploy = 300 updates | **Safe** ✅ |
| **Websites** | Unlimited | 1 Active | **Safe** ✅ |
| **Serverless Functions**| 125,000 / month | 0 (We don't use them) | **Safe** ✅ |

### 2. Do you need "AI Credits"?
**No.** 🛑
*   **Netlify AI Credits** are for running server-side AI models (like hosting a private connect to OpenAI on their servers).
*   **Your Strategy**: We implemented "Client-Side Logic" for the Career Quiz and the visual effects.
    *   The "AI" logic runs in the visitor's browser (JavaScript).
    *   **Cost to you:** $0.
    *   **Performance:** Instant (no server lag).

### 3. Forms (Lead Gen)
*   **Netlify Forms** (Built-in) has a limit of **100 submissions/month** on the free tier.
*   **Your Solution**: We used **FormSubmit.co** for your contact form.
    *   This bypasses the Netlify limit.
    *   You get email leads directly for free.

### Conclusion
Stick to the **Free Tier**.
You typically only need to upgrade ($19/mo) if:
1.  You get more than **50,000 - 100,000 visitors per month**.
2.  You want to add password protection (Team features).

For now, your site is extremely cost-efficient! 🚀
