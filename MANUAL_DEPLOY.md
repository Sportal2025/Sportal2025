# 🚨 Emergency Deployment Guide (Bypass Limits)

Since you hit the **300 Build Minutes** limit on Netlify, we can't use the automatic GitHub connection right now.

**Don't Worry! You don't need to pay.**
We will use the **Manual Drag & Drop** method. This uses your computer's power to build the site, saving your Netlify credits.

### Step 1: Locate the Build Folder
I have just finished building your site locally. The ready-to-launch files are in:
`/Users/drgauravpant/.gemini/antigravity/playground/harmonic-granule/dist`

### Step 2: Drag & Drop to Netlify
1.  Go to [app.netlify.com](https://app.netlify.com).
2.  Click on your site (**sportalcorporate**).
3.  Go to the **Deploys** tab.
4.  Scroll down to the bottom where it says **"Need to update your site?"**.
5.  Drag the `dist` folder from your file manager and drop it into that box.

### Step 3: Success!
Netlify will upload the files directly (without "building" them) and your site will be live instantly. 🟢

**Tip:** In the future, you can keep doing this for free, or pay ~$7/month for extra build minutes if you prefer the automatic GitHub way.
